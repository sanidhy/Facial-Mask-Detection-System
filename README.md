# Facial-Mask-Detection-System
Facial Mask Detection is a Python Program that help to detect the person is wearing facial mask in real time. Its Objective is to recognize the person on image/video stream wearing face mask with help of Computer vision and deep learning. If Several faces are present, each face is bounded by a red or green box and thus we know the position of the faces. The goal to design a binary face Classifier which can detect facial Mask. The model requires inputting an RGB image of any random size. This Classifier is implemented in Keras, and the output of the model is a feature vector
